                    <h3>OWL</h3>
                    <p>Owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls' asymmetrically placed ear cavities.</p>
                    <p>Owls have binocular vision, but they must rotate their entire heads to change the focus of their view because, like most birds, their eyes are fixed in their sockets.</p>
                    <p>Owls are farsighted and cannot clearly see anything nearer than a few centimetres of their eyes.</p>
                    <p>Different species of owls produce different sounds; this distribution of calls aids owls in finding mates or announcing their presence to potential competitors, and also aids ornithologists and birders in locating these birds and distinguishing species.</p>
                    <p>Sexual dimorphism is a physical difference between males and females of a species. Female owls are typically larger than the males.</p>
                    <p>The degree of size dimorphism varies across multiple populations and species, and is measured through various traits, such as wing span and body mass.</p>
