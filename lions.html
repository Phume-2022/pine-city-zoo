                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <P>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India.</P>
                    <p>It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.</p>
                    <p>It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</p>
                    <p>It is a social species, forming groups called prides.</p>
                    <p> A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</p>
                    <p>Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates.</p>
                    <p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films.</p>
