                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. </p>
                    <p>Its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb). Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown.</p>
                    <p>Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations are possibly separate subspecies, but not all researchers accept this.

Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. </p>
                    <p>Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring. </p>
                    <p> Like other marsupials, koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development. They crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they live for their first six to seven months.</p>
                    <p> They are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.

Because of their distinctive appearance, koalas, along with kangaroos, are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia.</p>
                    <p>They were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. </p>
                    <p>The koala has several adaptations for its low nutrient, toxic, and fibrous diet.[10]: 76  The animal's dentition consists of incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw) that are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals).</p>
                    <p>The koala bites a leaf with the incisors and clips it with the premolars at the petiole, before chewing it to pieces with the cusped molars.[22]: 46  Koalas may store food in their cheek pouches before it is ready to be chewed.[38] The partially worn molars of koalas in their prime are optimal for breaking leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine,[17]: 231  which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy.</p>
                    <p>A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.[39]</p>
                    <p>Koalas can retain food particles for longer fermentation if needed. They are more likely keep smaller particles as larger ones take longer to digest.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are asocial and spend just 15 minutes a day on social behaviours. In areas of higher density and fewer trees, home ranges are smaller and more clumped.[10]: 98  Koala society appears to consist of "residents" and "transients": the former are mostly adult females and the latter are males.</p>
