                    <h3>SEA TURTLE</h3>
                    <p>The leatherback sea turtle is the largest sea turtle.</p><p>As adults, it is possible to tell male turtles from female turtles by their long tails with a cloacal opening near the tip. </p><p>Adult female sea turtles have shorter tails, with a cloacal opening near the base. </p>
                    <p>In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts. </p>
                    <p>This tapering at both ends reduces volume and means that sea turtles cannot retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection, unlike many other turtles and tortoises.</p>
                    <p>Sea turtles are thought to reach sexual maturity from about 10âˆ’20 years old depending on species and methodology. </p>
                    <p>Sea turtles are caught worldwide, although it is illegal to hunt most species in many countries.</p>
                    <p>Sea turtle grazing helps maintain the health of the sea grass beds.</p>
