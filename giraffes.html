                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14–19 ft) tall, with males taller than females.[48] The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female.[49] Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short.[50]: 66  The skin is mostly gray[49] or tan,[51] and can reach a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in).[52]: 87  The 80–100 cm (31–39 in) long[37] tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.</p>
                    <p> Male giraffes become darker as they grow old. The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands.[37] When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best</p>
                    <p>Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern. Calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits is correlated with calf survival.[43] The skin under the blotches may regulate the animal's body temperature, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands.[56] Spotless or solid-color giraffes are very rare, but have been observed.</p>
                    <p>Both sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, which can reach 13.5 cm (5.3 in). They are formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin, and fused to the skull at the parietal bones.[44][52]: 95–97  Being vascularised, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation,[56] and are used in combat between males.</p>
                    <p>The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length.</p>
